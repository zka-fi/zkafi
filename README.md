# ZKAFI 

A Zero-Knowledge Real World Asset (RWA) lending protocol. 
Use Credentials to borrow money in Web3 World. Make a strong connection between Traditional Finance & Web3 World.

ZKAFI has the capability to connect with services such as insurance companies. This innovative project offers a unique value in the form of a ZK proof certificate, enabling users to effortlessly borrow money from the DeFi world. The interest and pool funds are jointly provided by borrowers and banks, creating a mutually beneficial financing ecosystem that allows companies to extract even greater value from their transactions.

There are 4 repos:

1. Contract (Solidity): Using Solidity to complete the whole lending protocol.

2. Circuits (Circom): Using Circom to develop the on-chain verification method.

3. Merkle-Tree (Typescript): Sparse Merkle Tree (SMT) method.

4. Front-end (WAGMI): Use NextJS and WAGMI.

Tech:

1. Polygon ID backend circuits

2. Hardhat deployed EVM-Compatible Chain

3. ZK-EVMs Deployed and tested

We deployed the contract to `Goerli`, `Sepolia`, `Mantle`, `Scroll Alpha`, `Polygon Mumbai`, `Gnosis`, `Celo`.

Therefore we can use this certification to borrow money on any chain.

We also publish an SMT in npm.
